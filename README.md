**`Rugby Performance Analyst looking to get into Web Testing`**

I am a self-motivated and approachable individual. Having gathered experience as a Performance Analyst within different rugby environments around the world, hands-on proficiency in Microsoft Office, MacOS and Sports Analysis Softwares.
Aside from proven technical abilities, I possess an array of soft qualities including bilingualism (Welsh and English) - which will help with liaising with stakeholders. I have held multiple positions of responsibility, demonstrating reliability within a team and as an individual showing time-management and organisational skills that integrate into the workplace well.
